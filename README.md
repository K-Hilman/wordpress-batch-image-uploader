# WordPress Batch Image Uploader

## Description
The WordPress Batch Image Uploader is a Python application that facilitates the upload of multiple image files to a WordPress site via its REST API. This tool allows users to upload images in batches, automatically checking for duplicates and generating a report of the upload status for each image. It features a simple and intuitive graphical user interface created using Tkinter.

Sometimes, using WordPress's native bulk uploader can overwhelm the server, potentially causing outages. This tool provides a more controlled approach by processing uploads in manageable batches. WordPress treats each upload as a standard file submission, ensuring images are properly compressed and stored according to WordPressâ€™s default structure. This method minimizes server strain while maintaining seamless integration with your media library

## Installation and Setup

## Usage Guidelines
1. When the GUI launches, click the "Select Images" button to browse your file system.
2. Select the image files you want to upload (supports: jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, bmp, tiff).
3. The progress of the uploads will be displayed through the progress bar, along with the status of each image in the main window.
4. A CSV report will be generated after the upload is complete, detailing the upload status of each image.

## Features
- Batch upload of images to a WordPress site.
- Automatic detection of duplicate images to avoid unnecessary uploads.
